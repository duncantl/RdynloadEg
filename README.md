This directory contains some examples illustrating the effects of
using different arguments to the dyn.load() function in R on how the
symbols are loaded, resolved and shared.

See [index.html](index.html) for an explanation.

To build the examples, type
```shell
make
```
at the shell prompt.
You can run the code in code.R.
